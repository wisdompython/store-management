# üõí Simple E-commerce API

Hey there! Welcome to my **Simple E-commerce API** project. This is an inventory management system I built for a basic e-commerce platform, where users can register, log in, manage products, and place orders.

## üöÄ Project Overview

This project was a great opportunity for me to dive deeper into Django and Django REST Framework. It's designed to handle core functionalities like user authentication, product management, and order processing, all backed by a PostgreSQL database and deployed on a cloud server for reliability.

### Key Technologies & Tools:
- **Django & Django REST Framework**: For the backend logic and API handling.
- **PostgreSQL**: For storing data efficiently.
- **JWT Authentication**: To keep user data secure and authenticated.
